# NewShades desktop and web client

This is the home of the NewShades desktop and web client.

Although you might find some native desktop builds on our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/NewShadesDAO/front/releases), the easiest way to follow along at this early stage is to access the regular web app on [app.newshades.xyz](https://app.newshades.xyz).
